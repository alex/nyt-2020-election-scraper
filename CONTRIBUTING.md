## Contributing

Welcome! :wave:

We're happy to consider new contributions to the project. That being said, a core aim of this project is comparative simplicity in the user interface, and we need to balance new features against the cost of added complexity. We feel we're approaching a logical point of feature completion, and at this point are focusing more on refinements that improve performance and reduce bugginess.

This is to say that we ask two things, before you open a pull request:

1. Please open an issue to discuss your proposal with the developers.

2. Please follow the [pull request template](https://github.com/alex/nyt-2020-election-scraper/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md).
