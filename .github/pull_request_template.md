**IMPORTANT: Please make sure you have checked the following list of DOs and DONTs before submitting a pull request.**

*DO*

- If this PR resolves a currently open issue, **refer** to that issue in the description of your PR. For example, if it closes issue #35, say "Resolves issue #35". GitHub will automatically hyperlink the issue and associate the PR to it.

- If this PR introduces a major UI change, include a screenshot showing the specific change in behavior. You can drag and drop a screenshot directly onto the PR text to have it attached by GitHub.

*DO NOT*

- Do not manually change any automatically generated files. In particular, do not change the `*.html`, `*.json` or `*.csv` files. For the majority of functionality you will want to edit the Python script. Be sure that you do not commit any locally changed files when you submit your PR.
