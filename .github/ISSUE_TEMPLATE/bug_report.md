**Describe the bug**

Please make sure you're not reporting that the hurdle calculation is incorrect! Please see https://github.com/alex/nyt-2020-election-scraper/pull/367; the block breakdown might not match the hurdle because of the way third-party candidates affect the calculations. We don't have plans to change this.
